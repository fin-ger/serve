# serve

A basic HTTP file server in Go

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/serve/server?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/serve/server)

### Features

* Fast
* Single binary
* Logs with modifiable timestamps and response times (colorized when running in a terminal)
* Directory listing supporting multiple content types (`html`,`json` and `xml`) via the `Accept` header
* Directory downloads via on-demand `zip` and `tar` [archive](https://github.com/jpillora/archive)s
* Optional PushState (HTML5 History API) mode (missing directories returns the root)
* LiveReload for automatic browser refresh (combines with [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en))
* Fallback proxy (missing requests defer to another server)

### Install

**Binaries**

See [the latest release](https://github.com/jpillora/serve/releases/latest) or download it with this one-liner: `curl i.jpillora.com/serve | bash`

```

### Usage

```
serve --help
```

<tmpl,code: go run main.go --help>
``` plain 

  Usage: serve [options] [directory]
  
  [directory] from which files will be served (default .)
  
  Options:
  --host, -h        Host interface (default 0.0.0.0)
  --port, -p        Listening port (default 3000)
  --livereload, -l  Enable LiveReload, a websocket server which triggers 
                    browser refresh after each file change
  --pushstate, -s   Enable PushState mode, causes missing directory paths 
                    to return the root index.html file, instead of a 404. 
                    This allows correct use of the HTML5 History API.
  --noindex, -n     Disable automatic loading of index.html
  --noslash         Disable automatic slash insertion when loading an 
                    index.html or directory
  --nolist          Disable directory listing
  --noarchive       Disable directory archiving (download directories by 
                    appending .zip .tar .tar.gz, archives are streamed 
                    without buffering)
  --quiet, -q       Disable all output
  --timefmt, -t     Set timestamp output format (default [2006-01-02 
                    15:04:05.000])
  --open, -o        On server startup, open the root in the default browser 
                    (uses the 'open' command)
  --fallback, -f    Requests that yeild a 404, will instead proxy through 
                    to the provided path (swaps in the appropriate Host 
                    header)
  --help          
  --version, -v   
  
  Version:
    0.0.0
